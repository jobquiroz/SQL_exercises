While the left join includes all rows in the table before the JOIN clause, the right join includes all rows in the new table in the JOIN clause. We can see a right join in the Venn diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/venn3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following two queries, one using a left join and one using a right join, produce identical results.\n",

    "SELECT f.name country, c.name city\n",

    "RIGHT JOIN facts f ON f.id = c.facts_id\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason a right join would be used is when you are joining more than two tables. In these cases, using a right join is preferable because it can avoid restructuring your whole query to join one table. Outside of this, right joins are used reasonably rarely, so for simple joins it's better to use a left join than a right as it will be easier for your query to be read and understood by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other join type not supported by SQLite is a full outer join. A full outer join will include all rows from the tables on both sides of the join. We can see a full outer join in the Venn diagram below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/venn4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like right joins, full outer joins are reasonably uncommon, and similar results can be achieved using a union clause (which we will teach in the next mission). The standard SQL syntax for a full outer join is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT f.name country, c.name city\n",
    "FROM cities c\n",
    "FULL OUTER JOIN facts f ON f.id = c.facts_id\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",

    "When you're writing complex queries with joins and subqueries, it helps to follow this **process**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Think about what data you need in your final output\n",
    "- Work out which tables you'll need to join, and whether you will need to join to a subquery.\n",
    "    - If you need to join to a subquery, write the subquery first.\n",
    "- Then start writing your SELECT clause, followed by the join and any other clauses you will need.\n",
    "- Don't be afraid to write your query in steps, running it as you go— for instance you can run your subquery as a 'stand alone' query first to make sure it looks like you want before writing the outer query.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be writing a query to find the **countries where the urban center (city) population is more than half of the country's total population**. Our final results will look like this. For expected results, we rounded to six decimal places; however, when running your query, don't worry about rounding the urban_pct column.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you out, the query you will write will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A join to a subquery.\n",
    "- A subquery to make a calculation.\n",
    "- An aggregate function.\n",
    "- A WHERE clause.\n",
