    "Structured Query Language, or SQL, is more than forty years old, and it is one of the most popular technologies used by data professionals, including data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers. Understanding the fundamentals of a more general-purpose language like Python or R is critical for working with data, but knowing SQL helps data professionals do more with their data. And if working with R or Python is one of your goals, SQL can help gather insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few key reasons why learning SQL will help anybody interested in working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL is everywhere.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all of the biggest names in tech use SQL — which is pronounced either “sequel” or “S.Q.L.” Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have built their own high-performance database systems, but even their data teams use SQL to query data and perform data analysis. And it’s not just tech companies: companies big and small around the world use SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL enables us to pull data from many sources.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many real-word situations, data is distributed across many sources. SQL allows us to select specific data and transform it to fit our needs. For example, working with spreadsheets can be difficult if the data we need to answer our question is distributed across many files. SQL allows us to structure our data in a way that makes it accessible from one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/sql.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL data is structured into multiple, connected tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL is here to stay.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stack Overflow annual Developer Survey, which is the largest and most comprehensive survey of programmers around the world, consistently reveals that SQL is one of the most popular technologies used today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out this Dataquest blog post if you'd like to learn more about why it's important to learn SQL. And if you'd like to learn more about how to learn SQL online with Dataquest, check out this blog post for some tips and tricks to learn SQL online.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's learn about the language itself and how you can use it to query data.\n"

    " A database structures data just like a spreadsheet by organizing data in different tables, which are comprised of rows and columns. \n",
    " \n",
    " A database can store much more data more securely than a spreadsheet or a text file. Unlike simply opening a spreadsheet, we actually have to \"ask\" for data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We primarily interact with a database using a database management system (DBMS) — a computer program to help users interact with data by giving the computer instructions through the DBMS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin learning SQL with the DBMS SQLite. SQLite is a lightweight DBMS, and it is the most popular database in the world."
